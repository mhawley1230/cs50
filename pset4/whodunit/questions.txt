1.  What’s stdint.h?
- A header file that contains a set of integer types having specific widths, for example int8_t is a signed integer with a width 
of 8 bits and uint16_t is an unsigned integer with a width if 16 bits.
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
- The point is for having them as data types to allocate a specific amount of memory from storage.
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
- A BYTE is 8 bytes, a DWORD is 32 bytes, a LONG is 32 bytes, and a WORD is 16 bytes.
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file 
formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
- In hexidecimal, it's 0x42 and 0x4d. 66 and 77 in decimal. B and M in ASCII.
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
- bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file and biSize is the size of the bitmap image, the BITMAPFILEHEADER, and 
BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
- If the biHeight is negative, the bitmap file cannot can be compressed.
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
- biBitCount specifies bits per pixel.
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
If the input or output file location doesn't exist, then fopen returns NULL.
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
The third argument is always 1, because it denotes the number of data elements to be read.
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
- The value that would be assigned to padding is 2.
11. What does fseek do?
- fseek uses a given offset to change a pointer location.
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
- The current location of the pointer within the file.
